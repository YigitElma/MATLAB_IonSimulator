# Particle in Cell Ion Thruster Simulator 
A very simple 2D ion simulator for quick testing and plotting purposes. The code simulates the grid region of an ion thruster which has accelerator and screen grids. Given the plasma parameters, it will create particles and track them in electric field. You can solve Laplace or Poisson's equation for potential using finite difference method. Although this is not a whole PIC code, it is written to give some basic understanding of the trajectory of the particles.
